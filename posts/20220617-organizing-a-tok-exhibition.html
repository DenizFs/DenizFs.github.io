			<h1>Organizing a TOK Exhibition</h1>
			<time>2022-06-17</time>
			<p>The last few months have been very exhausting. My classmates and I
			were planning our school's TOK exhibition, and because our TOK teacher
			had assigned me, I took on, among other things, the role of accountant as
			the "appointed" leader.</p>
			<p>It is true that teamwork makes the dreamwork, because without the help
			of my friends I could neither plan it alone nor cope with the stress.
			Therefore, I would like to sincerely thank everyone involved and my close
			friends for all their efforts, time and support.</p>
			<p>As for some advice: be decisive as a leader, show your teammates that
			you value their efforts and have a plan for every scenario. The last
			advice applies especially to accounting, because as students we made our
			money by organising several fairs and it was never certain how much money
			we would have. That's why I have five files for accounting that I worked
			on into the night.</p>
			<p>I have to say this: Before this exhibition I never wanted to take on
			the role of leader or co-leader. So I would like to thank my TOK teacher
			for making me have this experience, however stressful and tiring it was.
			Many thanks to my dear friend Elif for everything. Since she has a more
			expressive personality, I suggest you look at this exhibition from her
			point of view on her
