			<h1>Learning C Programming</h1>
			<time>2022-04-16</time>
			<p>Aside from my little experience with Javascript, C was the first
			programming language I learnt. It has been a bumpy journey as Windows is
			not the best environment unless you use something like Visual Studio or
			Visual Studio Code with extensions. For the future I plan to install a
			GNU/Linux distribution, because I understand from my research that it is
			a better platform for development.</p>
			<p>To learn, I read Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie's book "The C
			Programming Language". It was an enjoyable read even though I had
			difficulties with Windows from time to time. However, thanks to these
			difficulties, I did more research and gained more insight into the world
			of computers.</p>
			<p>So far I am interested in computer graphics, but for now C doesn't
			seem to be the best choice for developing on Windows. I will do more
			research and hopefully I will have a project that I can present with real
			graphics instead of just text output to the terminal. Also, I used Vim
			for programming all this time, and I must say that it was a very pleasant
			experience, especially after having got used to the keybindings. So my efforts
			were not in vain.</p>
