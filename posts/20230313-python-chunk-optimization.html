			<h1>Python: Chunk Optimization</h1>
			<time>2023-03-13</time>
			<p>I have been improving my Python programming skills for a while now. I
			am satisfied with the knowledge and skills I have acquired so far, but I
			also want something more concrete, more specifically involving graphics.
			I had been thinking about project ideas, but this one started not as a
			project, but as an experiment. In this project, we generate a random set
			of points on a plane and draw a line between points that are at most 100
			units apart.</p>
			<p>The challenge is that the naive algorithm, where for each point we
			iterate over all other points to check if they are close enough to each
			other, has a time complexity of O(n^2). Given that Python is an
			interpreted language, it is only expected that this approach slows down
			to 10 frames per second (FPS) when only a mere 100 points are
			generated.</p>
			<p>The technique I used to solve this problem is a technique commonly
			used in games: chunk optimization. I divided the plane into square chunks
			of the same dimensions as the maximum line length. This way we ensure
			that there is a line between all points that are at a distance from each
			other that is less than the specified maximum line length. I used classes
			to organize my code and this helped a lot during the development. Here
			are two images with 100 and 200 points respectively and the FPS in the
			upper left corner:</p>
