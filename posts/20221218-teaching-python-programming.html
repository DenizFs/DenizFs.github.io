			<time>2022-12-18</time>
			<p>With the experience from my last interpreter project in Python, I
			decided to teach Python programming to my friends, because in this age
			almost everyone can benefit from knowing a programming language in some
			way. Due to the time constraints we all had because of school, we had
			difficulty meeting for the classes.  Still, I can say that it went well
			because at least they grasped the basics of Python and got a taste of
			programming. Here is the curriculum we followed:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Variables</li>
				<li>Strings</li>
				<li>Lists</li>
				<li>Loops</li>
				<li>Operators</li>
				<li>Fibonacci sequence</li>
				<li>If-then-else</li>
				<li>Dictionaries</li>
				<li>Input/output</li>
				<li>Functions</li>
			</ol>
			<p>I did not go into too much detail with classes and many other aspects
			of Python so as not to bore them, but I explained the most useful
			built-in functions and asked them to solve some simple problems to make
			sure they understood the contents of the lessons.</p>
