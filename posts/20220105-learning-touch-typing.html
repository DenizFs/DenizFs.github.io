			<time>2022-01-05</time>
			<p>I've been learning to touch type for a while now. I got my computer
			only a year ago and had never bothered to learn to type properly. I then
			realised the necessity of touch typing when I was trying to learn to use
			Vim.</p>
			<p>There are many websites you can visit to practise, but my preference
			was the <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">Monkeytype</a> website, which I
			found the most beautifully designed user interface. I practiced touch
			typing for 20-30 minutes every day. However, you should remember that the
			aim here is not to write fast but to write correctly. The former is the
			result of the latter. I'm happy with the accuracy I have at my current
			speed, so I'm going to take a break from practicing and focus on writing
			meaningful things.</p>
