			<h1>Learning to Use Vim</h1>
			<time>2021-12-15</time>
			<p>My first project is to learn how to use Vim. Recently I became
			interested in programming and I was looking for a text editor I could
			use. I saw many people recommending Visual Studio Code, but it seemed too
			complicated and while researching I found Vim. I was amazed by both its
			usability and the history it has.</p>
			<p>I spent most of my free time reading Vim documentation and online
			guides about Vim. It is a very customizable text editor, so there are
			tons of things to do. Despite this, I have to remind you, do not spend
			too much time configuring and get to work. I spent too much time
			configuring my .vimrc file and eventually decided to delete it and
			replace it with a simple but effective .vimrc. For those interested, here
			it is:</p>
			<pre><code>filetype plugin indent on
set autoindent
set clipboard=unnamed
set incsearch ignorecase smartcase
set laststatus=2
set nomodeline
set shortmess=asWAIcF
set statusline=\ %f\ %m%=%l:%-3c\ "
set wildmenu
let mapleader = ' '
nnoremap &#60;leader&#62;l :ls&#60;CR&#62;:b&#60;space&#62;
nnoremap &#60;silent&#62; &#60;leader&#62;n :set nu! cul!&#60;CR&#62;</code></pre>
