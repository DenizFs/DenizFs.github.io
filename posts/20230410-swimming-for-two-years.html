			<h1>Swimming for Two Years</h1>
			<time>2023-04-10</time>
			<p>At the beginning of the IB Diploma Programme (IBDP), my back hurt from
			carrying around the 900-page Mathematics: Analysis and Approaches HL 2
			book, and I decided to swim to relieve the pain. I noticed that when I
			swam I calmed down and slept better at night, so I continued to swim at
			least two km per hour each time. Some weeks I tried to swim longer as I
			had extra time, and some weeks I could not swim at all because I was busy
			with exams or assignments.</p>
			<p>Looking back over the past four semesters, I am glad that I continued
			to swim throughout the program. The IBDP is very stressful and
			exhausting, so I highly recommend everyone to do some physical activity
			to relax themselves. This will not only help you mentally, but also
			protect your health, something that overwork can do a lot of harm to. Any
			sport without a high risk of injury is suitable, but I suggest that you
			try swimming.</p>
