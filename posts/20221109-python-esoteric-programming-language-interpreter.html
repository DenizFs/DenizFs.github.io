			<h1>Python: Esoteric Programming Language Interpreter</h1>
			<time>2022-11-09</time>
			<p>After programming in C and understanding the fundamentals of
			programming, I decided to learn a higher-level programming language and
			program a simple project. While researching programming languages and
			paradigms, I came across a language whose name I will refrain from
			mentioning due to its inappropriateness.</p>
			<p>This language has only eight commands: "><+-.,[]". Most commands were
			very easy to implement thanks to the simplicity of the language, with the
			exception of square brackets. For them, I used pen and paper to come up
			with an algorithm that would work as the file content was read, without
			first creating a dictionary of square brackets. Instead, I used a stack
			data structure, which is perfect for this kind of last in, first out
			data.</p>
			<p>After having developed a working interpreter, I challenged myself to
			write this as concisely and cleanly as possible to learn more about
			Python. The final version of my program looks like this:</p>
			<pre><code>import sys, os

f = open(sys.argv[1], 'r')
program, ip = list(filter(lambda c: c in "><+-.,[]", f.read())), 0
cells, cell_ptr = [0] * 30000, 0
brackets, bracket_cnt = [], 0

while ip < len(program):
    op = program[ip]

    if op == '>': cell_ptr += 1
    elif op == '<': cell_ptr -= 1
    elif op == '+': cells[cell_ptr] = cells[cell_ptr] + 1 if cells[cell_ptr] < 255 else 0
    elif op == '-': cells[cell_ptr] = cells[cell_ptr] - 1 if cells[cell_ptr] > 0 else 255
    elif op == '.': os.write(1, cells[cell_ptr].to_bytes())
    elif op == ',': cells[cell_ptr] = ord(os.read(0, 1))
    elif op == '[':
        if cells[cell_ptr]: brackets.append(ip)
        else:
            while not (program[ip] == ']' and bracket_cnt == 0):
                if program[ip] == '[': bracket_cnt += 1
                elif program[ip] == ']': bracket_cnt -= 1
                if bracket_cnt: ip += 1
    elif op == ']':
        if cells[cell_ptr]: ip = brackets[-1]
        else: brackets.pop()

    ip += 1

f.close()</code></pre>
