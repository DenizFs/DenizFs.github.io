			<h1>Installing Gentoo Linux</h1>
			<time>2023-06-02</time>
			<p>For the past years, I have been doing research on GNU/Linux and its
			various distributions. When I finally got the courage and time, I decided
			to install Gentoo Linux. The installation process was smooth and quite
			simple thanks to the help of the
			<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Main_Page">Gentoo Handbook</a>.</p>
			<p>However, after completing the installation process and rebooting, I no
			longer had wireless connection. It seems that I have one of the
			problematic network interface cards (NIC), the Broadcom BCM4313.
			Unfortunately I still have not solved this problem, but I have some
			resources that may help you if you have a similar problem with the same
			brand of NIC. Here are some links to driver-related documents that may
			help you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/b43">b43</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/brcm80211">brcm80211</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://jimbob88.github.io/gentoo/broadcom_wifi_drivers.html">broadcom-sta Installation Guide</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Although the problem remains unsolved, I have learned a lot about how
			Linux drivers work and how to troubleshoot a problem. I am very excited
			that this is just the beginning of many projects I plan to program on
			this operating system that I just installed on a decade old computer. If
			you are running on an old computer like me, expect long compilation times
			until you configure the kernel and set the USE flags to make programs
			lighter.</p>
