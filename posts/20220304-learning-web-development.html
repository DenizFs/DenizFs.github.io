			<time>2022-03-04</time>
			<p>This website you are currently viewing was coded by myself. I learnt a
			lot about web standards to make sure I created a proper website and I
			hope you like the look. One of the biggest challenges in this project was
			to make the website look good without compromising accessibility, so I
			designed it to look minimal with few colours.</p>
			<p>I had a hard time deciding which version of HTML to write my website
			in. I looked at the XHTML 1.1 standard, and while I quite liked the idea
			of strictness behind it, HTML 5 was my final choice because of the
			improvements in accessibility for people with vision problems. Another
			reason I tried to keep the website minimal was so that it would use less
			bandwidth for people with slow internet connections like me.</p>
			<p>Writing HTML manually is a bit annoying, but I think I'll get used to
			it over time. I am sure I do not want to use a blogging service as I want
			to have absolute control over my website. This is the first time I'm
			using Vim for a real project, which was a bit strange, but I think I'm
			getting used to it. The touch typing exercises were also very
			helpful.</p>
